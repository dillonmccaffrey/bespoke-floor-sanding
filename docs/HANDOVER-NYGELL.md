## 2. Getting Real Photos

The website currently uses AI-generated placeholder images. Real photos will make a huge difference!

### What We Need

| Type | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Before/After pairs | 5-10 | Same angle, same room - before and after sanding |
| Finished floors | 10+ | Beautiful completed work, good lighting |
| Work in progress | 3-5 | Shows professionalism, equipment in action |
| You working | 2-3 | Builds trust, shows the person behind the business |

### Photo Tips
- **Landscape orientation** works best (phone sideways)
- **Good lighting** - natural daylight is best
- **Clean the room** - remove clutter from frame
- **Multiple angles** - wide shot + detail shot of wood grain
- **High resolution** - don't compress before sending

### How to Send
- WhatsApp or email to Dillon
- Google Drive/Dropbox link works great for many photos
- Name files descriptively: `kitchen-oak-after.jpg`, `hallway-before.jpg`

## 3. Getting Real Testimonials

### Who to Ask
Think of your happiest customers - the ones who:
- Complimented your work
- Referred you to others
- Left you a tip or thank you

### What to Ask For
Send them a message like:

> "Hi [Name], I'm updating my website and would love to include a testimonial from you. Would you mind writing a few sentences about your experience? Just mention what work was done and what you thought of the result. A first name and location (like 'Mary, Castleblayney') is perfect. Thanks!"

### Format Needed
- **Quote**: 2-3 sentences about their experience
- **Name**: First name is fine
- **Location**: Town name (helps with local SEO!)
- **Photo** (optional): Their floor, or a headshot

### Example
> "Nygell transformed our 100-year-old oak floors - they look brand new! Very professional, tidy work, and great value. Highly recommend."
> — *Sarah, Carrickmacross*
